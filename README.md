# Fundraising Intern Portal UI

## Overview 

This is a simple, single-page React application that simulates a fundraising intern portal. It provides a clean, responsive user interface with dummy data for a light-themed experience. The app is a static UI and does not include any backend integration or live data fetching.


## Features
* Login/Sign-Up Page: A static UI for user authentication (no functional logic).

* Dashboard: Displays intern-specific information, including name, referral code, total donations raised, and a section for rewards/unlockables.

* Leaderboard: Ranks a list of mock interns by their donation scores. The top three entries are highlighted.

* Announcements: A feed of static announcements or dummy messages.

## Future Improvements
This project can be extended with the following features:

* Backend Integration: Connect the UI to a real API to handle user authentication and fetch live data.

* Profile Management: Allow interns to update their profile information.

* Interactive Rewards: Make the rewards system functional, allowing interns to "unlock" items as they reach new milestones.
  
* Theme Toggle: Add a button to switch between the current light theme and a dark theme.
